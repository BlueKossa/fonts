* About
Gives access to the Monaspice Nerd Font before the nix package is updated for it.

I am choosing not to include the font files in this repository; the flake is set up to download them from their sources, so that there are no licensing issues. This does mean, however, that the flake is subject to [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot][link rot]]. If this does become an issue, I will update the library with the required files.
